\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

In this paper, we aim to address the challenges in designing a high performance ETA system with the x86 processors provisioned at enterprises' network edge. In the proposed \texttt{ACETA} system, we study machine learning techniques for the identification of encrypted malware network flows. Specifically, we first explore and design multiple sets of features and four machine learning models over a public dataset. We then implement accelerated versions of the four machine learning models without sacrificing classification accuracy using Intel DAAL and OpenVINO. Our experimental results have demonstrated both the feasibility as well as the boosted training and inference performance of such a framework. Going beyond the experiments, our future work will focus on implementing an real-time ETA system for uCPE devices at network edge that comprises of online feature extraction, speeded model training and real-time inference.
